      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a recipe made undoubtedly better than no other country but Ghana</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Rice</li>
         <li>Black eye beans</li>
         <li>Waakye leaves </li>
         
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Wash the beans and add into the pressure cooker.</li>
         <li>Wash the waakye leaves and also add into the pressure cookers. Pour in water up to the minimum level on the pot.</li>
         <li>Close the valve of the pressure cooker and leave until it reaches full pressure. This should take no more than 15 mins.</li>
         <li>Once it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and leave for additional 10 mins for the beans to cook.</li>
         <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool down naturally to depressurize. This should take around 20 mins.</li>
         <li>Pour the beans with the cooking liquid and the waakye leaves into another pot. Wash the rice and pour into the pot too.</li>
         <li>Add more water if needed so there is enough to cook the rice. Add some salt and cover the pot.</li>
         <li>Allow the rice to cook. The time for this depends on the type of rice used. Check pack instructions if you are not sure.</li>
         <li>Remove the waakye leaves and serve with your favourite side.</li>
